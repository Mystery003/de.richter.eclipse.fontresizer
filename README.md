Eclipse Font Resizer
====================

This Eclipse plugin was inspired by the TextMate and IntelliJ IDEA functionality to change the size of the editor font by using some keyboard shortcut to do so. In TextMate you can use `CTRL`+`+` to increase the font size and `CTRL`+`-` to decrease the font size.
IntelliJ IDEA supports the same functionality by pressing `CTRL` and using the scrollwheel of your mouse to change the font size.

This plugin provides several ways of changing the size of the font quickly:
  * use `CTRL`+`Numpad +` to increase the size of the font
  * use `CTRL`+`Numpad -` to decrease the size of the font
  * use `CTRL`+`Numpad =` to reset the font size to the initial size
  * use the provided toolbar icons
  * use the additional menu entries
  * use `CTRL`+`Mousewheel` to increase/decrease the font size

  Note: Using the Mousewheel will only provide increase and decrease functionality, but no reset option.
