Eclipse Font Resizer
====================

This Eclipse plugin was inspired by the TextMate and IntelliJ functionality to change the size of the editor font by using some keyboard shortcut to do so. In TextMate you can use `CTRL`+`+` to increase the font size and `CTRL`+`-` to decrease the font size.
IntelliJ supports the same functionality by pressing `CTRL` and using the scrollwheel of your mouse to change the font size.
